Much easy, so MXNet. Wow.
========================

MXNet is widely used in production environments owing to its strong reputation
for speed. Now with ``gluon``, MXNet's new imperative interface (alpha), doing
research in MXNet is easy.

This project contains an incremental sequence of tutorials to make learning
gluon easy (meta-easy?). These tutorials are designed with public presentations
in mind and are composed as Jupyter notebooks where each notebook corresponds to
roughly 20 minutes of rambling and each codeblock could correspond to roughly
one slide.
