In practice, unless you're trying to develop fundamentlally new recurrent layers, you'll want to use the prebuilt layers that call down to extremely optimized primitives. But we think in general, if you're going to work with this stuff, and have a modicum of self respect, you'll want to implement from scratch and understand how it works at a reasonably low level."
