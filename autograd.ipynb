    "# Automatic differentiation with ``autograd`` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we want models to get better and better as a function of experience. Usually *getting better*, means minimizing a *loss function*, a measure of how *bad* our model is at any time. With neural networks, that loss is usually differentiable, i.e. for each of the model's parameters, we can always determine how much increasing or decreasing it might affect the loss. For complex models, working out these derivatives from scratch can be a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "_MXNet_'s autograd package eliminates this tedious work by automatically calculating derivatives for you. Other libraries require you to pre-define and compile symbolic graphs in order to access automatic derivatives. However, ``autograd``, much like the similar package in PyTorch, allows you to take derivatives even when running fully imperative code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, every time you make pass through your model, autograd builds a graph on the fly, through which it can immediately backpropagate gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through it step by step. For this tutorial, we'll only need to import ``mxnet.ndarray``, and ``mxnet.autograd``."
