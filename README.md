# mxnet-the-straight-dope
Much easy, so MXNet. Wow.

## Summary
MXNet is widely used in production environments owing to its strong reputation for speed.

Now with ``gluon``, MXNet's new imperative interface (alpha), doing research in MXNet is easy. 

This repo contains an incremental sequence of tutorials to make learning ``gluon`` easy (meta-easy?). These tutorials are designed with public presentations in mind and are composed as Jupyter notebooks where each notebook corresponds to roughly 20 minutes of rambling and each codeblock could correspond to roughly one slide.


## Inspiration 

In creating these tutorials, I've borrowed heavily from some of the resources that were most useful when I learned how to program with Theano and PyTorch, specifically:

* [Soumith Chintala's helladope "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz"](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
* [Alex Radford's bare-bones intro to Theano](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials)

## Table of Contents 
* NDArray 
* autograd
* Linear Regression
