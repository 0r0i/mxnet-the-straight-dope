If you completed the corresponding chapters on linear regression, you might be tempted rest your eyes a little in this one. We'll be using ``gluon`` in a rather similar way and since library is reasonably well designed, you won't have to do much differently. To keep you awake we'll introduce a few subtle tricks. \n",

In fact, ``gluon`` doesn't allocate our parameters. Instead it defers allocation and initialization to the first time we actually make a forward pass through the model with real data.
