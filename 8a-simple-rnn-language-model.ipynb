    "#  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING: DRAFT**\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous tutorials, we worked with *feedforward* neural networks. They're called feedforward networks because each layer feeds into the next layer in a chain connecting the inputs to the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/multilayer-perceptron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration $t$, we feed in a new example $x_t$, by setting the values of the input nodes (orange). We then *feed the activation forward* by successively calculating the activations of each higher layer in the network. Finally, we read the outputs from the topmost layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when we feed the next example $x_{t+1}$, we overwrite all of the previous activations. If consecutive inputs to our network have no special relationship to each other (say, images uploaded by unrelated users), then this is perfectly acceptable behavior. But what if our inputs exhibit a seqeuntial relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example that you want to predict the next character in a string of text. We might devide to feed each character into the neural network with the goal of predicting the succeeding character. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/recurrent-motivation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the neural network forgets the previous context every time you feed a new input. How is the neural network supposed to know that \"e\" is followed by a space? It's hard to see why that should be so probable if you didn't know that the \"e\" was the final letter in the word \"Time\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks provide a slick way to incorporate sequential structure. At each time step $t$, each hidden layer $h_t$ (typically) will receive input from both the current input $x_t$ and from *that same hidden layer* at the previous time step $h_{t-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/recurrent-lm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when our net is trying to predict what comes after the \"e\" in time, it has access to its previous *beliefs*, and by extension, the entire history of inputs. Zooming back in to see how the nodes in a basic RNN are connected, you'll see that each node in the hidden layer is connected to each node at the hidden layer at the next time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/simple-rnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the neural network contains loops (the hidden layer is connected to itself), because this connection spans a time step our network is still technically a feedforward network. Thus we can still train by backpropagration just as we normally would with an MLP. Typically the loss function will be an average of the losses at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to roll up our sleeves and write a simple RNN in MXNet using nothing but ``mxnet.ndarray`` and ``mxnet.autograd``. In practice, unless you're trying to develop fundamentlally new recurrent layers, you'll want to use the prebuilt layers that call down to extremely optimized primitives. You'll also want to rely some pre-built batching code because batching sequences can be a pain. But we think in general, if you're going to work with this stuff, and have a modicum of self respect, you'll want to implement from scratch and understand how it works at a reasonably low level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and import our dependencies and specify our context. If you've been following along without a GPU until now, this might be where you'll want to get your hands on some faster hardware. GPU instances are available by the hour through Amazon Web Services. A single GPU via a [p2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/) (NVIDIA K80s) or even an older g2 instance will be perfetly adequate for this tutorial."
