    "Dot products are useful in a wide range of contexts. For example, given a set of weights $\\mathbf{w}$, the weighted sum of some values ${u}$ could be expressed as the dot product $\\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{w}$. When the weights are non-negative and sum to one ($\\sum_{i=1}^{d} {w_i} = 1$), the dot product expresses a *weighted average*. When two vectors each have length one (we'll discuss what *length* means below in the section on norms), dot products can also capture the cosine of the angle between two vectors."

    "* **Symmetric Matrix** These are matrices where the entries below and above the diagonal are the same. In other words, we have that $M^\\top = M$. An example of such matrices are those that describe pairwise distances, i.e. $M_{ij} = \\|x_i - x_j\\|$. Likewise, the Facebook friendship graph can be written as a symmetric matrix where $M_{ij} = 1$ if $i$ and $j$ are friends and $M_{ij} = 0$ if they are not. Note that the *Twitter* graph is asymmetric - $M_{ij} = 1$, i.e. $i$ following $j$ does not imply that $M_{ji} = 1$, i.e. $j$ following $i$.\n",
    "* **Antisymmetric Matrix** These matrices satisfy $M^\\top = -M$. Note that any arbitrary matrix can always be decomposed into a symmetric and into an antisymmetric matrix by using $M = \\frac{1}{2}(M + M^\\top) + \\frac{1}{2}(M - M^\\top)$. \n",
    "* **Diagonally Dominant Matrix** These are matrices where the off-diagonal elements are small relative to the main diagonal elements. In particular we have that $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ij}$ and $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ji}$. If a matrix has this property, we can often approximate $M$ by its diagonal. This is often expressed as $\\mathrm{diag}(M)$. \n",
    "* **Positive Definite Matrix** These are matrices that have the nice property where $x^\\top M x > 0$ whenever $x \\neq 0$. Intuitively, they are a generalization of the squared norm of a vector $\\|x\\|^2 = x^\\top x$. It is easy to check that whenever $M = A^\\top A$, this holds since there $x^\\top M x = x^\\top A^\\top A x = \\|A x\\|^2$. There is a somewhat more profound theorem which states that all positive definite matrices can be written in this form. "

And a lot of that math *is* useful for machine learning. For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors, and these decompositions can reveal low-dimensinoal structure in real-world datasets. There are entire subfields of machine learning that focus on using matrix decompositions and their generalizations to high-order tesors to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems. But this book focuses on deep learning. And we believe you'll be much more inclined to learn more mathematics once you've gotten your hands dirty deploying useful machine learning models on real datasets. So while reserve the right to introduce more math much later on, we'll wrap up this chapter here."
